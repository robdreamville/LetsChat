My objective with this blog is to tell my personal story on the path to become a software developer (whatever spot that may be, leaning towards full stack and machine learning). To show my struggles and how the mindset of an inner-city youth at times does not correlate with a programming career. With hopes that it will reach someone in a similar position as me and encourage them to pursue a career in tech. <br /> <br />

The best way to start this blog is to start with an introduction of myself, I am Roberto Galdamez. I am a first generation American, born and raised in Jersey City. currently I am senior at New Jersey City University, and I am studying Computer Science. I have an 8-year-old son who I love very much. <br /><br />
The reality in the world is that we are in the age of technology. Everyone interacts with various computers in their day-to-day life yet only a few in the grand scheme of things understand the processes going on behind the scenes. It is easy to say that the country needs to prioritize STEM in schools to get kids motivated in the tech field, but I feel like it is deeper than that as well. It is a mindset thing that has a lot to do with the general mental health of the people and kids in particular who can’t handle serious problems like depression and anxiety. Speaking from my own experience, I was dealing with issues that I could not even begin to comprehend until I grew older.<br /> <br />
Tech is one the biggest and highest paying fields in the US and yet the people in this country do not meet the demand for employees in this field. I notice that a lot of the people being hired are coming from abroad and while I do think that has its benefits such as different perspectives, I would like to see people from my own communities taking these roles as well and reaping the benefits of it. Jersey City as in many places in this country has been gentrified a lot in the past 20 years. Tech companies are coming in and mostly hiring people from other places rather than Jersey City natives. Yes, that has to do with who has the knowledge to work these jobs but I genuinely feel like we are failing to properly equip our people to handle these positions in large scale.<br /> <br />
I grew up in the hood in Jersey City. My parents immigrated here from Honduras a couple of years before I was born. Something that I will forever be grateful for. They did it with the intention to give their kids a better life and in term of general resources in the country, we did get that. I say that because I have been to Honduras several times in my life and have witnessed the poverty. At the same time though there was a great lack of resources in my own life and I’m sure in the lives of other who share similar experiences to me. My parents worked all day, and since the age of 7 I was being left home alone with my two older brothers. I know they loved me very much and were truly doing the best they could, but it did affect me. It affected my mental health in various ways, and I am extremely grateful that I can see these issues that I have within myself and work on them for the sake of myself and the world. I hope that can somehow impact the people in my community and with similar backgrounds as me to get into the tech field because I do believe this field will only continue to rise.
